+What are some suggestions to make this ui more modern, (color, typography, borders, size, font, etc.)

# 2023-10-20 14:38:46.795509

# 2023-10-20 14:41:40.672724
+I am not seeing the updated, changes can you link these css files with their corresponding tsx file

# 2023-10-20 14:47:08.106738
+Perfect, lets keep improving on the ui. Here are some UI principles that modern crypto startups are using. :ark Mode: This trend has gained traction across many apps and platforms, and crypto startups are no exception. A dark theme often provides a modern and sophisticated look.
+Neumorphism: A design trend characterized by soft UI, where elements have a soft, extruded plastic look. It's a sort of successor to skeuomorphism but with more subtlety and softness.
+Minimalism: Clean interfaces with ample whitespace, focusing on essential elements and getting rid of unnecessary clutter. This helps users focus on key actions and information.
+Vibrant and Bold Colors: Especially to distinguish brands in a crowded market, vibrant colors can make crypto startups stand out. Using unique and vibrant color schemes can help brands stay memorable. 

# 2023-10-20 14:48:35.525552
+Lets proceed with these changes and we will go with your recommendations for  for the dark theme and vibrant elements and color choices which will follow industry standard UI principles and follows the crypto style startup UI practices

# 2023-10-20 14:49:05.989196
+yes, proceed

# 2023-10-20 14:50:18.612009
+Yes, lets continue

# 2023-10-20 14:51:00.089228
+Implement the neumorphism that you proposed and the vibrant and bold colors

# 2023-10-20 14:51:36.832263
+Continue with the next steps

# 2023-10-20 14:55:02.863733

+Lets make one change at a time, lets align the SwapForm and Portfolio to center of the page, from both the top/bottom and left/right so these elements are next to eachother but in the center overall

# 2023-10-20 15:11:59.917777

+Can we make the size of swap form more narrow to properly align all the elements together

# 2023-10-20 15:15:27.909400
+What are some suggestions to improve on the SwapForm, right now it feels to cramped, the swap button is on the bottom left, overall it needs to be improved

# 2023-10-20 15:18:31.886592
+Can you analyza the overall design and suggest how to improve it

# 2023-10-20 15:19:52.914189
+Can you make the text on the navigation bold, all capital, and appropriate font size

# 2023-10-20 15:21:03.080170
+can you make the components for the portfolio the same height and width and center them together side by side 

# 2023-10-20 15:22:01.603650
+The height is taking up the whole paging obfuscating the other components,

# 2023-10-20 15:24:21.653907
+can you put the swapform and portfolio side by side, and round the corners on the left side for the swap and right side for the portfolio

# 2023-10-20 15:25:50.048419
+There is still spacing in between the swapform and the portfolio, which doesnt give the illusion they are together

# 2023-10-20 15:42:33.647053
+can you make the swapform and portfolio to have a consistent box shadow in which follow neumorphism principles

# 2023-10-20 15:43:32.267982
+Can you apply this same thing to the navigation toolbar

# 2023-10-20 15:51:21.459555
+align the navigation buttons a little closer, they are too close to the edge of the box

# 2023-10-20 15:52:35.204806
+can you remove the shadow on portfolio on the left side only, right now its overlaying on swapform and it doesnt look like one component

# 2023-10-20 15:54:46.244795
+maybe we need to combine portfolio and swapform to have the effect of the shadow box to appear as one, right now this part of portfolio box shadow is still overlaying to the swap form, messing up the continuity 0px -10px 20px #343434;

# 2023-10-20 15:57:03.334683
+Okay that worked, but now the elements from the swap form and portfolio are overlapping, can you give them some spacing as well vertical since the swapform is too close to the edges

# 2023-10-20 16:33:35.978184
+Center the title MySwap to the middle and round the corners of the logo

# 2023-10-20 16:57:42.961216
+When swapping the amounts can you make sure the rates are all aligned, in which when I swap 1 ETH for DAI the values are not adding up

# 2023-10-20 16:59:26.562608
+Let me input an amount

# 2023-10-20 17:01:12.472604
+Although in the swapform when I type an amount the zero stays in place and doesnt allow me to have a longer input or use decimals, there is also an up and down arrow there which is not needed

# 2023-10-20 17:01:58.401593
+When I backspace to remove the zero it shows NaN as opposed to just nothing and let me input an amount

# 2023-10-20 17:03:28.563343
+The input box for Amount is not working properly, it doesnt let me remove the zero and input a decimal value. I want to be able to do this "0 -> 0.5 or -> *blank*"

# 2023-10-20 17:04:29.432642
+When I backspace it does not remove the 0, and it just stays there. This input box should be more simple than it is.

+I updated this project to complete this excercise: Exercise: Emulate a Decentralized Exchange Using Functional Programming
+
+In this exercise, you will use functional programming to create a basic emulation of a decentralized exchange (DEX). We will contrast the difference between a central limit order book (CLOB) approach and an automated market maker (AMM) approach.
+
+Use the existing ../workspaces/mySwap/ project subdirectory for this assignment.
+
+Exercise Instructions:
+
+Define the core data structures:
+
+typescript
+
+// Data Structures for CLOB
+
+type Order = {
+  id: string;
+  type: 'BUY' | 'SELL';
+  price: number;
+  quantity: number;
+};
+
+type OrderBook = Order[];
+
+// Data Structures for AMM
+
+type Reserve = {
+  tokenX: number;
+  tokenY: number;
+};
+
+type Liquidity = {
+  proportion: number;
+};
+Central Limit Order Book (CLOB):
+
+placeOrder: This function should accept an order (Order) and an order book (OrderBook) as arguments. It should return a new order book with the new order added in the appropriate position, maintaining the order from highest to lowest price.
+
+cancelOrder: This function should accept an id and an order book (OrderBook) as arguments. It should return a new order book with the order with the matching id removed.
+
+matchOrders: This function should accept an order book (OrderBook) as an argument. It should return a new order book with any matched buy and sell orders with the same price removed. It should also return the matched orders.
+
+Automated Market Maker (AMM):
+
+addLiquidity: This function should accept an amount of each token (Reserve) and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amounts of each token increased by the appropriate amount.
+
+removeLiquidity: This function should accept a proportion of liquidity to remove (Liquidity) and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of each token decreased by the appropriate amount, and the amounts removed.
+
+swap: This function should accept a token to remove from the reserve, the amount to remove, and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of the input token decreased by the specified amount and the amount of the other token increased by the calculated amount. It should also return the calculated amount of the other token.
+
+Remember to maintain the invariant for AMM: x*y=k, where x and y are the amounts of the two tokens in the reserve and k is a constant.
+
+Note: This exercise is designed to illustrate the basic concepts of a CLOB and an AMM in a DEX. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as transaction fees, price slippage, user balances, and smart contract interactions would need to be taken into account.

# 2023-11-02 10:54:08.553842
+I updated the assignment to complete the exercise, will paste the description after this. Update the README to match the updated project: tral Limit Order Book (CLOB):
+
+placeOrder: This function should accept an order (Order) and an order book (OrderBook) as
+ arguments. It should return a new order book with the new order added in the appropriate
+ position, maintaining the order from highest to lowest price.
+
+cancelOrder: This function should accept an id and an order book (OrderBook) as arguments
+. It should return a new order book with the order with the matching id removed.
+
+matchOrders: This function should accept an order book (OrderBook) as an argument. It sho
+uld return a new order book with any matched buy and sell orders with the same price remo
+ved. It should also return the matched orders.
+
+Automated Market Maker (AMM):
+
+addLiquidity: This function should accept an amount of each token (Reserve) and the curre
+nt reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amounts of each token incre
+ased by the appropriate amount.
+
+removeLiquidity: This function should accept a proportion of liquidity to remove (Liquidi
+ty) and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of
+each token decreased by the appropriate amount, and the amounts removed.
+
+swap: This function should accept a token to remove from the reserve, the amount to remov
+e, and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of t
+he input token decreased by the specified amount and the amount of the other token increa
+sed by the calculated amount. It should also return the calculated amount of the other to
+ken.
+
+Remember to maintain the invariant for AMM: x*y=k, where x and y are the amounts of the t
+wo tokens in the reserve and k is a constant.
+
+Note: This exercise is designed to illustrate the basic concepts of a CLOB and an AMM in
+a DEX. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as transaction fees, pric
+e slippage, user balances, and smart contract interactions would need to be taken into ac
+count.

+Similar to the CLOB Dashboard, lets create one for the AMM functionalities. Lets do this step by step in creating the visual components. We already implemented the functions

# 2023-11-02 11:08:25.174305
+The handleAddLiquidity function is currently just logging the input values to the
+console. In the next step, we will replace this with a call to the addLiquidity function
+from our AMM module.

# 2023-11-02 11:09:41.513593
